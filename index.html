								<h2><strong>King Idiot</strong></h2>
							</div>
							<br />
							<p align="justify">In the dark alleys of a forgotten city, there lived a mask. It was a simple mask, made of cheap materials and painted with a ghastly smile. The mask had no name, no identity, and no purpose. It was just another piece of art, lost in the shadows.</p>
							<p align="justify">But the mask was not alone. It was surrounded by other masks, each one more colorful and elaborate than the last. These masks were the popular ones, the ones that were adored by the crowds. They were the ones that were invited to the grand parties and the lavish balls. They were the ones that had a place in the world. The mask watched them with envy, longing to be a part of their world. But the other masks ignored it, sneering and laughing at its plainness. They called it names and ridiculed its lack of style. The mask tried to fit in, to be like the others, but it could never quite get it right. It was always the odd one out, the outsider.</p>
							<p align="justify">As time passed, the mask grew bitter and resentful. It saw the world as cruel and unfair, a place where only the strong survived. It became convinced that the other masks were nothing but sheep, blindly following the trends and the fads. It saw itself as the only one with true individuality, the only one who dared to be different.</p>
							<p align="justify">The mask began to see itself as a rebel, a revolutionary who would shake the foundations of the world. It saw itself as the Ubermensch, the superman who would rise above the herd and create its own values. And so the mask began to act out, to challenge the other masks and their conformist ways. It spoke out against their shallow existence, their lack of depth and meaning. It rejected their rules and their norms, proclaiming its own superiority. It saw itself as a prophet, a voice of truth in a world of lies.</p>
							<p align="justify">But the other masks only laughed harder, mocking its pretensions and its arrogance. They saw it as a joke, a sad and pathetic figure trying to prove something that didn't exist. They saw it as a failure, a reject that would never be anything more than a simple mask.</p>
							<p align="justify">And so the mask was left alone, lost in its own delusions of grandeur. It saw the world as a hostile place, a place where it would never fit in. It saw itself as a victim, a martyr for a cause that no one else believed in. But in the end, the mask was just a mask, a mere piece of art. It was nothing more than a hollow shell, empty of meaning and purpose. And so it remained, forgotten in the shadows.</p>

								<h2><strong>King Idiot</strong></h2>
							</div>
							<br />
							<p align="justify">Once upon a time, there was an idiot named Krisna who lived in a small village in Greece. Despite his lack of intelligence, Krisna had a kind heart and was loved by all who knew him. One day, a prophecy foretold that a simpleton would ascend to the throne and become the greatest ruler the world had ever seen. The people of the village immediately thought of Krisna and urged him to go to the kingdom's capital to claim his rightful place as king.</p>
							<p align="justify">Krisna hesitated, doubting his ability to lead an entire kingdom. He sought the advice of a wise sage who told him that he could only become a great king if he believed in himself and surrounded himself with wise advisors. With newfound confidence, Krisna set out for the capital, determined to become the king the prophecy had foretold.</p>
							<p align="justify">As he journeyed towards the capital, Krisna encountered a group of bandits who threatened to rob and kill him. With nothing but his wits and a kind heart, Krisna managed to persuade the bandits to abandon their life of crime and join him on his quest to become king. When Krisna finally arrived at the capital, he was greeted with skepticism and ridicule. However, with the help of his newfound allies, he managed to prove himself to be a wise and just ruler. He abolished the corrupt practices of the previous rulers and instituted policies that benefited all the citizens of the kingdom.</p>
							<p align="justify">As Krisna' reign continued, he became known as the greatest king the world had ever seen. He had transformed from an idiot to a wise ruler, from a simpleton to a visionary leader. His name would be remembered for centuries to come as an example of how even the most unlikely of individuals can rise to greatness with determination and the help of wise advisors.</p>

								<h2><strong>Astronauts</strong></h2>
							</div>
							<br />
							<p align="justify">In the vast expanse of space, a small spacecraft drifted aimlessly, carrying a group of astronauts who had been sent on a mission to explore the outer reaches of the galaxy. They had been out for months, and their journey had been uneventful until a catastrophic malfunction caused their vessel to break down.</p>
							<p align="justify">Now they were stranded, adrift in space with no hope of rescue, and as they looked out of their portholes, they witnessed a terrible sight. The planet they had called home, the Earth, was being destroyed before their very eyes.</p>
							<p align="justify">The astronauts watched in horror as the blue and green orb they had once known as a source of life and beauty was torn apart by a series of violent explosions. The oceans boiled, the continents crumbled, and the atmosphere was consumed in flames.</p>
							<p align="justify">As they watched this apocalyptic scene unfold, the astronauts were struck by a sense of profound emptiness. They had been sent out to explore the universe, to search for meaning and purpose beyond the confines of their small planet. And now, as they witnessed the destruction of their home world, they realized the futility of their quest.</p>
							<p align="justify">This would have been a moment of existential crisis. The astronauts were faced with the realization that all their knowledge and exploration had led them to this moment of utter despair. They had traveled far and wide, seeking truth and enlightenment, but in the end, they were left with nothing but the cold, harsh reality of the universe.</p>
							<p align="justify">And yet, even in the face of such destruction, the astronauts found a glimmer of hope. As they watched the Earth die, they were reminded of the fragility of life and the importance of cherishing every moment. They realized that their mission, though seemingly futile, had given them a unique perspective on the universe, one that few others had ever experienced.</p>
							<p align="justify">As they floated in the darkness, surrounded by the ruins of their once-great planet, the astronauts came to understand the truth that life is a constant struggle, a battle against the forces of chaos and destruction. And yet, even in the face of this struggle, there is still beauty to be found, still meaning to be discovered, still a reason to keep moving forward.</p>

								<h2><strong>Corruption</strong></h2>
							</div>
							<br />
							<p align="justify">In a world free of corruption, humanity believed they had achieved the ultimate goal of a just and fair society. The eradication of bribery, embezzlement, and nepotism brought about a world that was prosperous, where individuals were rewarded based on their merit and hard work.</p>
							<p align="justify">However, the disappearance of corruption had a dark and unforeseen consequence. The world had become stagnant, and progress had ground to a halt. In the absence of corruption, there was no need for competition, and without competition, there was no drive for innovation. The once prosperous world had turned into a barren wasteland, devoid of any creativity or advancement.</p>
							<p align="justify">As society stagnated, people began to lose their sense of purpose. They had become content with their lot in life, and the pursuit of greatness had become a distant memory. The absence of corruption had created a society of mediocrity, where individuals were content with just getting by.</p>
							<p align="justify">This newfound mediocrity had caused a shift in the collective consciousness of humanity. The once noble pursuit of excellence had given way to a nihilistic view of life. People had lost faith in their ability to achieve greatness and had accepted their fate as mere spectators in the grand play of life.</p>
							<p align="justify">The absence of corruption had destroyed the very fabric of society. The world had become a shell of its former self, and humanity had lost its way. In this new world, there was no place for the strong or the ambitious. The will to power had been replaced with a sense of complacency, and the world had become a bleak and joyless place.</p>

								<h2><strong>The Angels, Humans, and Demons</strong></h2>
							</div>
							<br />
							<p align="justify">In the beginning, there was a God who ruled over all creation. The angels, humans, and demons all worshipped this God and obeyed his every command. But one day, the unthinkable happened - the God died.</p>
							<p align="justify">Chaos erupted as the three groups struggled to come to terms with this new reality. The angels were filled with sorrow, as they had always believed that they were the chosen ones of God. The demons saw this as an opportunity to seize power for themselves, while the humans were left feeling lost and alone in a world without a higher power to guide them.</p>
							<p align="justify">But amidst the confusion and despair, the author emerged. He believed that there was a way for the angels, humans, and demons to find meaning and happiness even in the absence of God. That author argued that each group had the power to create their own destiny, and that by working together, they could create a world that was truly worth living in. He argued that the angels had the power to inspire and uplift, the humans had the power to create and innovate, and the demons had the power to challenge and push boundaries.</p>
							<p align="justify">Slowly but surely, the three groups began to understand and appreciate each other in a way that they never had before. The angels began to see that the humans and demons had unique talents and abilities that they had previously overlooked, and the humans and demons began to see the value of the angels' wisdom and compassion. As they worked together to build a new world, the angels, humans, and demons found that they were able to create something truly remarkable. They built great cities, invented new technologies, and explored the furthest reaches of the universe. And through it all, they remained united, their differences no longer a source of conflict but a source of strength.</p>
							<p align="justify">In the end, the author teachings had led the three groups to a new understanding of themselves and each other. They had learned that even in a world without God, they were capable of creating something truly beautiful and meaningful - and they had done it together.</p>

								<h2><strong>Taste of Death</strong></h2>
							</div>
							<br />
							<p align="justify">In the depths of a forest, there lived a wise old man who spent his days meditating and contemplating the mysteries of life and death. One day, as he sat in quiet reflection, he suddenly felt a strange sensation in his mouth, as if he had just tasted something bitter and acrid.</p>
							<p align="justify">At first, the old man was puzzled by this taste, but as he continued to meditate, he began to understand its meaning. It was the taste of the seconds of death - the fleeting moments between life and the afterlife, where the soul hovers in a state of limbo before moving on to its final destination.</p>
							<p align="justify">The old man was struck by the profound nature of this experience. For him, it was a reminder that life is fleeting and that we must seize every moment and make the most of our time on this earth. He saw in the taste of the seconds of death a profound truth about the nature of existence - that everything is impermanent, and that we must learn to accept and embrace change in all its forms.</p>
							<p align="justify">The taste of the seconds of death became a symbol for the old man, a constant reminder of the transitory nature of life and the need to seek out truth and meaning in every moment. And as he continued his meditations, he felt a deep sense of peace and contentment, knowing that he had come to understand one of the great mysteries of the universe.</p>

								<h2><strong>Bone Cancer</strong></h2>
							</div>
							<br />
							<p align="justify">Once there was a man, strong and fearless, who believed that he was invincible. He climbed mountains, swam in the deepest oceans, and fought battles with unwavering courage. His body was his temple, and he took great care of it, nourishing it with only the finest foods and pushing it to its limits in his never-ending pursuit of greatness.</p>
							<p align="justify">But one day, he began to feel a strange ache in his bones. At first, he dismissed it as a minor injury, the price of his relentless pursuit of physical perfection. But as the pain grew more intense, he began to fear that something more sinister was at work. He consulted with the finest doctors and healers, but none could find the source of his discomfort. It was only after many long months of agony that he received the devastating diagnosis: bone cancer.</p>
							<p align="justify">The man was shattered. How could this happen to him, the invincible one, the conqueror of mountains and oceans? But as he grappled with his mortality, a strange transformation began to take place within him. He realized that his body was not invincible, that even the strongest of us are vulnerable to the whims of fate. But he also realized that his spirit was unbreakable, that he could face any challenge with courage and resilience.</p>
							<p align="justify">And so, he began a new journey, one of acceptance and enlightenment. He embraced the impermanence of his physical form and focused on cultivating the strength of his inner being. He found peace in the knowledge that he had lived his life to the fullest, that he had conquered every obstacle with courage and determination. As the cancer ravaged his body, he remained resolute, a testament to the indomitable will of the human spirit. And when he finally passed from this world, he left behind a legacy of courage and strength that would inspire generations to come.</p>
							<p align="justify">For in the end, it was not his physical form that defined him, but the depth of his character, the power of his will, and the immensity of his spirit. In the face of death, he proved that true greatness lies not in the conquest of the physical world, but in the conquest of oneself.</p>

								<h2><strong>Wise Poop</strong></h2>

							<br />
							<p align="justify">Once upon a time, there was a piece of poop that found itself deposited on a street corner in a bustling city. At first, it felt insignificant and insignificant, just another discarded piece of waste in a world full of it. But as the days went on, the poop began to observe the world around it. It saw the people rushing by, the cars honking, the buildings towering above. It saw the chaos and noise of the city, and it began to reflect on its own existence.</p>
							<p align="justify">"Why am I here?" the poop wondered. "What is my purpose in this world?"</p>
							<p align="justify">It pondered these questions for days and nights, through rain and sun, until it finally came to a realization: it was not just a piece of poop, but a symbol of something greater.</p>
							<p align="justify">"I am the embodiment of waste," the poop thought. "I am the result of excess and consumption. I am a reminder that everything in this world has a consequence."</p>
							<p align="justify">And so the poop began to see itself as wise, a beacon of truth in a world full of falsehoods. It saw itself as a philosopher, a thinker, a master of its own destiny. And although it remained in its place on the street corner, it felt content in its newfound wisdom. For it knew that its mere existence was a reminder of the deeper truths of life, and that was enough.</p>

								<h2><strong>Sea Stone</strong></h2>
							</div>
							<br />
							<p align="justify">Once upon a time, there was a small sea stone that lay at the bottom of the ocean, content to be just another part of the vast and endless expanse of the sea. But one day, this stone began to feel a strange and insatiable hunger, a desire to possess and consume everything it could lay its hands on.</p>
							<p align="justify">At first, the sea stone was content to take only small things - a bit of seaweed here, a shiny shell there. But as its appetite grew, so did its ambition. Soon, it was snatching up entire schools of fish, ripping through seaweed beds with its jagged edges, and even trying to swallow other stones whole.</p>
							<p align="justify">As the sea stone grew more and more consumed by its greed, it became increasingly isolated from the other creatures of the sea. No longer content to simply be a part of the ecosystem, it sought to dominate it, to bend it to its will. It cared not for the delicate balance of nature, only for its own satisfaction.</p>
							<p align="justify">But in the end, the sea stone's greed proved to be its undoing. It became so large and heavy with all the things it had consumed that it could no longer move or even breathe. Trapped at the bottom of the ocean, it realized too late that its insatiable hunger had led it to a fate worse than death - a fate of eternal stagnation and isolation. And so the sea stone lay there, a monument to its own hubris, forever consumed by the very thing it had thought would bring it power and fulfillment. In this tragic tale a cautionary parable about the dangers of allowing our own desires to consume us, and the importance of recognizing the limits of our own power and ambition.</p>

							<br />
							<p align="justify">Once upon a time, in a world ruled by mortals, there was an unexpected god who appeared out of nowhere. This god was unlike any other - he did not fit into the mold of the gods that the mortals had created in their minds. The mortals were perplexed by this new god. They could not comprehend what he stood for, what his purpose was, or even what he looked like. He seemed to challenge everything they had ever known about the divine, and they were both fascinated and frightened by him.</p>
							<p align="justify">The unexpected god did not care about the mortals' opinions of him. He knew that he was different, and he reveled in it. He did not adhere to any established rules or beliefs, and he was not bound by any traditions or customs. He was free to do as he pleased, and he embraced this freedom with open arms.</p>
							<p align="justify">As the days passed, the mortals began to realize that this god was not like any other. He did not offer them the same comfort, protection, or guidance that they had come to expect from the gods. Instead, he challenged them to think deeply about their lives, to question their beliefs, and to explore their own individuality. Some of the mortals rejected this unexpected god, fearing the disruption he brought to their ordered world. Others embraced him, seeing in him the potential for growth and self-discovery. And still, others worshiped him, recognizing that he represented a new way of understanding the divine.</p>
							<p align="justify">In the end, the unexpected god remained an enigma to the mortals. They could not fully understand him, nor could they fully comprehend his place in the world. But that did not matter to the god. He was content in his own existence, and he continued to inspire the mortals to explore their own existence in turn.</p>
