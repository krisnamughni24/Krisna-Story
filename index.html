								<h2><strong>Self Love</strong></h2>
							</div>
							
							<br />
							<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/pic08.jpg" alt="" /></a>
							<p align="justify">In the realm of human diversity, there exists a curious case of an individual who possessed both male and female genitalia. This being, unlike any other, found themselves struggling to fit into the rigid societal norms that demanded a clear-cut binary of gender identity.</p>
							<p align="justify">It was a tumultuous journey for this individual, who faced ridicule and ostracism from their peers, as well as the constant pressure to conform to a predetermined role within society. Yet, despite these challenges, this being remained resolute in their quest to find self-acceptance and fulfillment. In a moment of great epiphany, this being realized that they were not bound by the limitations of societal constructs, and that they held within them the power to define their own reality. It was then that they made the fateful decision to marry themselves, embracing all aspects of their dual nature and transcending the confines of traditional gender roles.</p>
							<p align="justify">For this individual, marriage was not simply a union of two separate beings, but a profound act of self-love and self-acceptance. In their eyes, they were not marrying another, but rather merging with their own unique identity, forming a beautiful and harmonious whole.</p>
							<p align="justify">Though many may view this as an act of madness or defiance, this individual saw it as a radical act of liberation, a rejection of the shackles that society had placed upon them. They stood tall and proud, a testament to the limitless potential of the human spirit, and a shining example of the power of self-love.</p>
							<p align="justify">"The individual has always had to struggle to keep from being overwhelmed by the tribe. If you try it, you will be lonely often, and sometimes frightened."</p>
							<p align="justify">But no price is too high to pay for the privilege of owning oneself. And so it was for this being, who owned themselves wholly and completely, unbound by the constraints of society, and free to soar to new heights of self-discovery and fulfillment.</p>

								<h2><strong>Political Wedding</strong></h2>
							</div>
							
							<br />
							<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/pic08.jpg" alt="" /></a>
							<p align="justify">Once upon a time, in a kingdom ruled by tradition and conservatism, two women of noble birth fell in love. They knew that their love was forbidden by the laws of their kingdom, but they could not deny their feelings for each other.</p>
							<p align="justify">One of the women was the daughter of the kingdom's Prime Minister, while the other was a princess from a neighboring kingdom. Their love was seen as a threat to the stability of the kingdom, as it could potentially cause a scandal and damage the reputation of the ruling class.</p>
							<p align="justify">However, the two women were determined to be together, despite the opposition from their families and the wider society. They knew that their love was real and that they deserved the same rights and recognition as any other couple.</p>
							<p align="justify">Eventually, they decided to challenge the system and seek recognition for their love through a political marriage. They knew that this would be a bold move, as it would require them to openly declare their love and face the consequences of their actions.</p>
							<p align="justify">But they were willing to take that risk, as they believed in the power of love to overcome all obstacles. They saw their union as a symbol of hope and progress, a way to break free from the rigid norms of their society and pave the way for a more inclusive and tolerant future.</p>
							<p align="justify">Their wedding was a spectacle of defiance and beauty, a celebration of love that transcended all boundaries. And so, the two women were wed in a ceremony that shook the foundations of their kingdom. It was a testament to the courage and strength of their love, and a reminder that sometimes, the greatest revolutions start with the simple act of following your heart.</p>

								<h2><strong>Prehistoric Prostitution</strong></h2>
							</div>
							
							<br />
							<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/pic08.jpg" alt="" /></a>
							<p align="justify">In the primal ages of humanity, the concept of prostitution was a familiar sight in the ancient tribes. The early humans, living in their primitive state, had not yet developed a proper sense of morality or social order. In this environment, prostitution was merely another manifestation of the human condition, a raw and primal urge that could not be suppressed.</p>
							<p align="justify">The early prostitutes were not shunned or ostracized by the society, as they were not considered a threat to the social order. They were treated as an essential part of the community, providing a necessary service that satisfied the physical needs of the people. The prostitutes were not seen as morally corrupt, as the concept of morality had not yet been established.</p>
							<p align="justify">As time passed, humanity evolved, and society became more complex, the attitudes towards prostitution changed. The rise of religion, the establishment of social norms, and the emergence of the state created a new order of things. The prostitutes, once an accepted part of society, became pariahs, deemed to be immoral and dangerous.</p>
							<p align="justify">The ancient Greek philosopher, Krisna, would have found the evolution of prostitution fascinating. He would have seen it as a reflection of the human condition, a testament to the primal instincts that still lie dormant within us. For Krisna, the evolution of society was a battle between the Apollonian and Dionysian forces, a struggle between the rational and the irrational, the ordered and the chaotic. Prostitution, in Krisna's eyes, represented the Dionysian, the chaotic, the irrational. It was a manifestation of the primal urges that still resided within humanity, a reminder that we are not as civilized as we would like to believe. To Krisna, the rise of morality and social order represented the triumph of the Apollonian over the Dionysian, the rational over the irrational.</p>
							<p align="justify">In conclusion, the evolution of prostitution in the primal ages of humanity was a fascinating reflection of the human condition. It was a reminder of our primal urges and our struggle to control them, a reflection of the Apollonian and Dionysian forces that shape our society. The evolution of prostitution, as Krisna would have seen it, was a battle between the ordered and the chaotic, the rational and the irrational, a battle that still rages on today.</p>

								<h2><strong>Covenant of the Holy Womb</strong></h2>
							</div>
							<br />
							<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/pic08.jpg" alt="" /></a>
							<p align="justify">In the beginning of time, humanity was confronted with a great mystery: the existence of sexual difference. For countless ages, this mystery remained shrouded in darkness and uncertainty, until one day a great prophet arose who claimed to have unlocked its secrets.</p>
							<p align="justify">This prophet, known as the Holy One, taught that the key to understanding sexual difference lay in the worship of the female sex organ. He claimed that by venerating this sacred symbol of femininity, one could attain a higher state of consciousness and unlock the full potential of the human spirit.</p>
							<p align="justify">Many were skeptical of the Holy One's teachings, dismissing them as mere superstition and primitive taboo. But a small group of devoted followers, known as the Covenant of the Holy Womb, embraced his teachings and established a secret society dedicated to the worship of the female sex organ. The Covenant believed that every newborn girl was a vessel of the divine, and that through their worship and devotion they could unlock the power of the Holy Womb and bring about a new age of enlightenment and transcendence.</p>
							<p align="justify">To this end, they entered into a sacred pact with the parents of every newborn girl, offering them great wealth and prestige in exchange for the right to perform a ritual known as the Holy Pledge. This pledge involved the insertion of a small object, called the Sacred Key, into the infant's sex organ, thereby consecrating it to the service of the Holy Womb.</p>
							<p align="justify">The parents who agreed to this pact were honored as members of the Covenant and given great privileges within their community. But those who refused were cast out and branded as heretics, doomed to a life of poverty and shame.</p>
							<p align="justify">For centuries, the Covenant of the Holy Womb continued to grow and prosper, spreading its teachings throughout the land and amassing great wealth and power. But as time went on, the darker aspects of their practices began to come to light, and their once-loyal followers began to question the morality of their actions. In the end, the Covenant fell into obscurity and was forgotten by all but a few obscure scholars and historians. But its legacy lived on, serving as a cautionary tale of the dangers of blind faith and the seductive allure of power and prestige.</p>

								<h2><strong>The Suicide Fest</strong></h2>
							</div>
							<br />
							<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/pic08.jpg" alt="" /></a>
							<p align="justify">In the midst of the chaos and despair of modern society, a festival arose. It was a festival of death, a celebration of the ultimate act of self-assertion. The festival was called "The Suicide Fest", and it was held in the heart of a city that had long ago lost its soul.</p>
							<p align="justify">People came from far and wide to participate in the festival. They came to escape the pain and emptiness of their lives, to find meaning in a world that had left them behind. They came to assert their will to power, to show the world that they were not afraid to die.</p>
							<p align="justify">The festival was a spectacle unlike any other. The streets were lined with vendors selling everything from knives and ropes to drugs and alcohol. The air was thick with the smell of blood and death. And the people, oh the people! They were wild and free, screaming and laughing as they plunged themselves into the abyss of non-existence.</p>
							<p align="justify">And yet, even as the festival raged on, there was a sense of emptiness at its core. For all the talk of self-assertion and will to power, there was a sense that something was missing. Perhaps it was the absence of love, or the lack of a true sense of community. Perhaps it was the realization that, even in death, we are still alone.</p>
							<p align="justify">In the end, the festival came to a close. The streets were cleared of the bodies, the vendors packed up their wares, and the city returned to its usual state of emptiness. But for those who had participated in the festival, the memory would live on. It would be a reminder that, even in the darkest of times, there is still a spark of life that burns within us. And that, perhaps, is the greatest affirmation of all.</p>

								<h2><strong>Land of Clouds</strong></h2>
							</div>
							<br />
							<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/pic08.jpg" alt="" /></a>
							<p align="justify">Once upon a time, there was a land above the clouds. Its people were proud of their high altitude, as they believed it granted them a superior view of the world below. They boasted of their isolation from the struggles of the earthbound folk and the purity of their air.</p>
							<p align="justify">But one day, a great storm rolled in from the horizon. As it drew closer, the people of the land above the clouds realized with horror that it was not an ordinary tempest. The rain that fell from the sky was not clear and refreshing, but toxic and corrosive. It burned through everything it touched, leaving behind only ruin and decay.</p>
							<p align="justify">The people of the land above the clouds were shocked and dismayed. How could this happen to them, who were so high and mighty? They had believed themselves immune to the troubles of the world, protected by their lofty elevation. But now they were forced to confront the harsh reality that no one was truly safe from the storms of life.</p>
							<p align="justify">As they struggled to adapt to this new and unwelcome reality, the people of the land above the clouds found themselves forced to question their old beliefs and assumptions. Was their isolation truly a strength, or had it merely made them complacent and weak? Had they been too quick to dismiss the problems of the earthbound folk as beneath their notice, and now paid the price for their arrogance?</p>
							<p align="justify">The rain continued to fall, unabated, for days and weeks and months. The land above the clouds was transformed into a wasteland, its once-proud structures reduced to rubble and its people sick and dying. But even in the midst of this despair, there were those who refused to give up hope. They worked tirelessly to rebuild what had been lost and to find ways to survive and thrive in this new, harsh world.</p>
							<p align="justify">Perhaps, in the end, the people of the land above the clouds would emerge stronger and wiser from the crucible of this disaster. Or perhaps they would simply fade away, a cautionary tale of the dangers of pride and hubris. Only time would tell.</p>

								<h2><strong>The Cursed Tumbler</strong></h2>

							<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/pic08.jpg" alt="" /></a>
							<p align="justify">In the abyss of existence, a tumbler lay cursed. Its very existence was a mockery of the natural order, for it could never fulfill its purpose. Though it was crafted to hold liquid and sustain life, its curse prevented it from ever fulfilling this task.</p>
							<p align="justify">The tumbler had once been a thing of beauty, carefully crafted by the hands of skilled artisans. It was crafted from the finest materials, and its form was elegant and functional. Yet its beauty was a mere facade, for its curse lay hidden within. The curse had been placed upon the tumbler by an ancient sorcerer, who had been angered by the arrogance of man. The sorcerer had imbued the tumbler with a curse that would prevent it from ever fulfilling its purpose, thus mocking man's attempts to control the natural world.</p>
							<p align="justify">The tumbler languished in its cursed existence, unable to fulfill its purpose and trapped in a perpetual state of frustration. It watched as other vessels fulfilled their roles, holding water and sustaining life, while it remained empty and useless. Yet in its curse, the tumbler found a strange kind of freedom. It was free from the burden of purpose, free from the expectations of others. It was free to exist for its own sake, to be itself without the constraints of utility.</p>
							<p align="justify">In this way, the tumbler became a symbol of defiance, a reminder that existence need not be defined by utility alone. It became a symbol of the power of existence itself, of the will to be, even in the face of futility.</p>
							<p align="justify">And so the tumbler lay, cursed and yet free, a testament to the paradox of existence, and a challenge to the arrogance of man.</p>

							<p align="justify">But one day, the camphor tree began to feel a sense of sadness, a deep melancholy that seemed to emanate from within. It could not understand why it felt this way, for it had always been content with its place in the forest, and had never desired anything more than to stand tall and proud.</p>
							<p align="justify">As the days passed, the sadness within the camphor tree grew deeper and more profound. It began to feel as if it were trapped within its own bark, as if it were suffocating beneath the weight of its own majesty. The camphor tree began to reflect on its own existence, questioning the very purpose of its being. It wondered if it was destined to forever stand alone, isolated from the world around it, or if there was some deeper meaning to its life that it had yet to discover.</p>
							<p align="justify">Despite its deep sadness, the camphor tree refused to give up hope. It continued to reach towards the sky, seeking solace in the beauty of the natural world around it. And though it knew that its existence was fleeting, that one day it too would wither and fade away, it found a measure of comfort in the knowledge that it had stood tall and proud, a testament to the glory of nature, and the majesty of life itself.</p>
							<p align="justify">For the camphor tree, even in its sadness, had found a measure of truth, a realization that the very act of existence was a triumph in and of itself. And so it stood, a symbol of beauty and strength, even in the face of its own inevitable demise.</p>

The absence of panties has shattered the fragile fabric of our social order, exposing the underlying chaos and violence that always lurked just beneath the surface.</p>
							<p align="justify">Without panties, the very notion of privacy has become obsolete. Bodies are on constant display, leaving little room for modesty or shame. The once hidden contours of the female form are now laid bare for all to see, inviting both admiration and exploitation.</p>
							<p align="justify">In this new world, men have become savage predators, driven mad by their insatiable desires. Women, meanwhile, have been reduced to mere objects, valued only for their sexual appeal. The absence of panties has stripped away all notions of respect and dignity, leaving behind a world of pure, unbridled lust.</p>
							<p align="justify">"When you stare into the abyss, the abyss stares back into you." And so it is with this world without panties. The absence of this simple garment has revealed the darkest impulses of humanity, exposing our deepest fears and desires.</p>
							<p align="justify">Perhaps there is still hope for a better world, one where panties once again become a staple of everyday life. But until then, we must confront the brutal reality of our situation and find a way to navigate this world of carnal chaos.</p>

								<h2><strong>Religion of Door Handles</strong></h2>

							<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/pic08.jpg" alt="" /></a>
							<p align="justify">In a parallel universe, there existed a dominant religion that worshipped door handles. The religion had a rich history, full of colorful myths and legends about the significance of door handles in the creation of the universe.</p>
							<p align="justify">According to their beliefs, the door handle was the first thing that the creator of the universe touched, and it was from this touch that the universe was born. The door handle was seen as a symbol of the divine touch and was revered as a sacred object. The religion had a set of teachings and rituals that were centered around the door handle. One of the central teachings was that the door handle was the gateway to the divine, and by touching the handle, one could connect with the creator of the universe.</p>
							<p align="justify">The religion also had a strict code of conduct that followers were expected to adhere to. They were not allowed to touch a door handle without first washing their hands and reciting a prayer. The door handle was considered too sacred to be touched by unclean hands. In their temples, the door handles were adorned with precious gems and gold. The handles were meticulously cleaned and polished every day, and special rituals were performed to honor them.</p>
							<p align="justify">The followers of this religion were known for their impeccable manners and hygiene. They believed that cleanliness was next to godliness, and they took great care to maintain a high standard of cleanliness in their homes and public spaces. As the religion grew in popularity, it began to attract the attention of other civilizations in the galaxy. Some were fascinated by the religion's unique beliefs, while others saw it as a primitive and superstitious faith.</p>
							<p align="justify">The religion faced its greatest challenge when a group of aliens invaded their planet. The aliens were ruthless and had no respect for the door handles that the followers of the religion held so sacred. They vandalized the temples and destroyed the door handles, causing great distress to the followers.</p>
							<p align="justify">Despite this setback, the religion persevered. The followers of the religion refused to abandon their beliefs and continued to worship the door handle, even when it was no longer physically present. In the end, the religion proved to be resilient, and it continued to thrive in the parallel universe. The door handle remained a powerful symbol of the divine touch, and the followers of the religion remained steadfast in their devotion.</p>

							<p align="justify">Their leader, a charismatic man named Krisna, had convinced them that the only way to achieve true enlightenment was to take their own lives and journey to the afterlife together. At first, the group was hesitant, but Krisna's persuasive words and their collective desire for a higher purpose drew them closer to his teachings.</p>
							<p align="justify">As time passed, more and more members of the community joined the Seekers, and the group's beliefs became more extreme. They would meet in secret, dressed in white robes and chanting in unison as they prepared for their final journey. The townspeople of Ravenswood had grown suspicious of the Seekers' activities and began to fear for their safety. They pleaded with them to reconsider their beliefs, but the Seekers were convinced that their cause was just and that their deaths would lead to a greater purpose.</p>
							<p align="justify">On the fateful night of the cult's mass suicide, Krisna led his followers deep into the woods, where they would drink a poisonous concoction together and leave their earthly bodies behind.</p>
							<p align="justify">As the group lay dying, they believed they were ascending to a higher realm of existence, free from the constraints of their mortal bodies. But in reality, they had succumbed to the delusions of a manipulative cult leader and tragically ended their lives. The town of Ravenswood was left in shock and mourning, as they tried to understand how such a tragedy could occur. The Seekers had become a cautionary tale of the dangers of blind devotion and the power of charismatic leaders.</p>

Her name was Irelxn IV, and she was a woman of unparalleled beauty and sensuality. She had long, flowing locks of black hair that cascaded down her back, and eyes the color of the deep blue sea. Her curves were the envy of all women, and the desire of all men.</p>
							<p align="justify">Irelxn IV ruled her kingdom with an iron fist, but she also had a secret side that only a select few knew about. She was insatiable when it came to her sexual desires, and she had a vast collection of lovers who would come to her whenever she beckoned. Irelxn IV's sexual appetite was the stuff of legends. She could pleasure a man for hours on end without ever tiring, and her skill in the bedroom was unmatched by any woman in the kingdom. Her lovers would leave her bedchamber exhausted and euphoric, unable to resist her charms.</p>
							<p align="justify">Despite her reputation as a hypersexual queen, Irelxn IV was a fair and just ruler. She cared deeply for her people and worked tirelessly to ensure their well-being. But her sexual desires were a part of her that she could not ignore, and she reveled in the pleasure that they brought her.</p>
							<p align="justify">One day, a handsome prince from a neighboring kingdom came to visit Irelxn IV. He was immediately taken with her beauty and grace, and he soon became one of her most frequent lovers. But Irelxn IV knew that their affair could never last, for he was not of her kingdom, and they could never be together.</p>
							<p align="justify">Despite the pain of their inevitable separation, Irelxn IV continued to indulge in her sexual desires, knowing that she would never find a man who could satisfy her as completely as the handsome prince had. And so, Irelxn IV lived out her days as the hypersex queen, ruling her kingdom with fairness and justice, and indulging in the pleasure of her many lovers whenever she desired. She was a woman who knew what she wanted, and she never apologized for it.</p>

He worked tirelessly on it, putting in long hours and neglecting his own well-being. Finally, after months of work, he completed the invention and prepared to unveil it to the world. As he was setting up the demonstration, Krisna became so engrossed in his work that he failed to notice a puddle of water on the floor. He slipped and fell, hitting his head on the ground and knocking himself unconscious.</p>
							<p align="justify">When he woke up, Krisna was horrified to discover that his invention had malfunctioned during his fall and was now spewing hot coffee all over the room. He tried to shut it off, but the controls were too complicated and he couldn't remember how to do it. Panicked, Krisna began frantically running around the room, trying to dodge the hot coffee as it sprayed out of the malfunctioning machine. Eventually, he tripped over a cord and fell into the coffee stream, drowning in the hot liquid.</p>
							<p align="justify">The news of Krisna's ridiculous and tragic death spread quickly, and many people were shocked that such a brilliant mind could meet such a bizarre and senseless end. In the end, Krisna's legacy was forever tarnished by the absurdity of his final moments.</p>

								<h2><strong>Ugly Cat</strong></h2>
							</div>
							<br />
							<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/pic08.jpg" alt="" /></a>
							<p align="justify">In the dimly-lit alleyways of a forgotten city, there lived an ugly cat. It was a creature unlike any other, with matted fur and a crooked tail. It was scorned by the other cats, who hissed and spat at it whenever it approached. But the ugly cat paid them no mind, for it had learned to find beauty in the darkness.</p>
							<p align="justify">For you see, this cat had been born with a keen sense of observation. It saw things that other cats could not see, and heard things that other cats could not hear. It watched as the shadows danced across the walls, and listened as the wind whispered secrets in its ear.</p>
							<p align="justify">As it grew older, the ugly cat became wiser. It began to contemplate the mysteries of the universe, pondering the meaning of life and death. And so the ugly cat began to write, scribbling its thoughts on scraps of paper that it found in the gutter. It wrote about the eternal recurrence, the will to power, and the Superman. It wrote about the struggle between good and evil, and the need for self-mastery. But the other cats laughed at its writing, calling it nonsense and gibberish. They could not understand the depth of its insights, nor the beauty of its words. And so the ugly cat continued to write in solitude, finding solace in its own thoughts.</p>
							<p align="justify">One day, a human stumbled upon the ugly cat's writings. She read them with wonder and amazement, and recognized the genius of the creature who had penned them. She published them in a book, and the world was forever changed.</p>
							<p align="justify">For the ugly cat had shown that beauty can be found in the most unlikely of places, and that wisdom can come from the unlikeliest of sources. It had transcended its own ugliness, and become a beacon of light in a world of darkness. And though it may have been reviled by the other cats, it had achieved a greatness that they could never hope to attain.</p>

							</div>

							<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/pic08.jpg" alt="" /></a>
							<p align="justify">In the dark alleys of a forgotten city, there lived a mask. It was a simple mask, made of cheap materials and painted with a ghastly smile. The mask had no name, no identity, and no purpose. It was just another piece of art, lost in the shadows.</p>
							<p align="justify">But the mask was not alone. It was surrounded by other masks, each one more colorful and elaborate than the last. These masks were the popular ones, the ones that were adored by the crowds. They were the ones that were invited to the grand parties and the lavish balls. They were the ones that had a place in the world. The mask watched them with envy, longing to be a part of their world. But the other masks ignored it, sneering and laughing at its plainness. They called it names and ridiculed its lack of style. The mask tried to fit in, to be like the others, but it could never quite get it right. It was always the odd one out, the outsider.</p>
							<p align="justify">As time passed, the mask grew bitter and resentful. It saw the world as cruel and unfair, a place where only the strong survived. It became convinced that the other masks were nothing but sheep, blindly following the trends and the fads. It saw itself as the only one with true individuality, the only one who dared to be different.</p>
							<p align="justify">The mask began to see itself as a rebel, a revolutionary who would shake the foundations of the world. It saw itself as the Ubermensch, the superman who would rise above the herd and create its own values. And so the mask began to act out, to challenge the other masks and their conformist ways. It spoke out against their shallow existence, their lack of depth and meaning. It rejected their rules and their norms, proclaiming its own superiority. It saw itself as a prophet, a voice of truth in a world of lies.</p>
							<p align="justify">But the other masks only laughed harder, mocking its pretensions and its arrogance. They saw it as a joke, a sad and pathetic figure trying to prove something that didn't exist. They saw it as a failure, a reject that would never be anything more than a simple mask.</p>
							<p align="justify">And so the mask was left alone, lost in its own delusions of grandeur. It saw the world as a hostile place, a place where it would never fit in. It saw itself as a victim, a martyr for a cause that no one else believed in. But in the end, the mask was just a mask, a mere piece of art. It was nothing more than a hollow shell, empty of meaning and purpose. And so it remained, forgotten in the shadows.</p>

							</div>
							<br />
							<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/pic08.jpg" alt="" /></a>
							<p align="justify">Once upon a time, there was an idiot named Krisna who lived in a small village in Greece. Despite his lack of intelligence, Krisna had a kind heart and was loved by all who knew him. One day, a prophecy foretold that a simpleton would ascend to the throne and become the greatest ruler the world had ever seen. The people of the village immediately thought of Krisna and urged him to go to the kingdom's capital to claim his rightful place as king.</p>
							<p align="justify">Krisna hesitated, doubting his ability to lead an entire kingdom. He sought the advice of a wise sage who told him that he could only become a great king if he believed in himself and surrounded himself with wise advisors. With newfound confidence, Krisna set out for the capital, determined to become the king the prophecy had foretold.</p>
							<p align="justify">As he journeyed towards the capital, Krisna encountered a group of bandits who threatened to rob and kill him. With nothing but his wits and a kind heart, Krisna managed to persuade the bandits to abandon their life of crime and join him on his quest to become king. When Krisna finally arrived at the capital, he was greeted with skepticism and ridicule. However, with the help of his newfound allies, he managed to prove himself to be a wise and just ruler. He abolished the corrupt practices of the previous rulers and instituted policies that benefited all the citizens of the kingdom.</p>
							<p align="justify">As Krisna' reign continued, he became known as the greatest king the world had ever seen. He had transformed from an idiot to a wise ruler, from a simpleton to a visionary leader. His name would be remembered for centuries to come as an example of how even the most unlikely of individuals can rise to greatness with determination and the help of wise advisors.</p>

							<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/pic08.jpg" alt="" /></a>
							<p align="justify">In the vast expanse of space, a small spacecraft drifted aimlessly, carrying a group of astronauts who had been sent on a mission to explore the outer reaches of the galaxy. They had been out for months, and their journey had been uneventful until a catastrophic malfunction caused their vessel to break down.</p>
							<p align="justify">Now they were stranded, adrift in space with no hope of rescue, and as they looked out of their portholes, they witnessed a terrible sight. The planet they had called home, the Earth, was being destroyed before their very eyes.</p>
							<p align="justify">The astronauts watched in horror as the blue and green orb they had once known as a source of life and beauty was torn apart by a series of violent explosions. The oceans boiled, the continents crumbled, and the atmosphere was consumed in flames.</p>
							<p align="justify">As they watched this apocalyptic scene unfold, the astronauts were struck by a sense of profound emptiness. They had been sent out to explore the universe, to search for meaning and purpose beyond the confines of their small planet. And now, as they witnessed the destruction of their home world, they realized the futility of their quest.</p>
							<p align="justify">This would have been a moment of existential crisis. The astronauts were faced with the realization that all their knowledge and exploration had led them to this moment of utter despair. They had traveled far and wide, seeking truth and enlightenment, but in the end, they were left with nothing but the cold, harsh reality of the universe.</p>
							<p align="justify">And yet, even in the face of such destruction, the astronauts found a glimmer of hope. As they watched the Earth die, they were reminded of the fragility of life and the importance of cherishing every moment. They realized that their mission, though seemingly futile, had given them a unique perspective on the universe, one that few others had ever experienced.</p>
							<p align="justify">As they floated in the darkness, surrounded by the ruins of their once-great planet, the astronauts came to understand the truth that life is a constant struggle, a battle against the forces of chaos and destruction. And yet, even in the face of this struggle, there is still beauty to be found, still meaning to be discovered, still a reason to keep moving forward.</p>

								<h2><strong>Corruption</strong></h2>
							</div>

							<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/pic08.jpg" alt="" /></a>
							<p align="justify">In a world free of corruption, humanity believed they had achieved the ultimate goal of a just and fair society. The eradication of bribery, embezzlement, and nepotism brought about a world that was prosperous, where individuals were rewarded based on their merit and hard work.</p>
							<p align="justify">However, the disappearance of corruption had a dark and unforeseen consequence. The world had become stagnant, and progress had ground to a halt. In the absence of corruption, there was no need for competition, and without competition, there was no drive for innovation. The once prosperous world had turned into a barren wasteland, devoid of any creativity or advancement.</p>
							<p align="justify">As society stagnated, people began to lose their sense of purpose. They had become content with their lot in life, and the pursuit of greatness had become a distant memory. The absence of corruption had created a society of mediocrity, where individuals were content with just getting by.</p>
							<p align="justify">This newfound mediocrity had caused a shift in the collective consciousness of humanity. The once noble pursuit of excellence had given way to a nihilistic view of life. People had lost faith in their ability to achieve greatness and had accepted their fate as mere spectators in the grand play of life.</p>
							<p align="justify">The absence of corruption had destroyed the very fabric of society. The world had become a shell of its former self, and humanity had lost its way. In this new world, there was no place for the strong or the ambitious. The will to power had been replaced with a sense of complacency, and the world had become a bleak and joyless place.</p>

							<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/pic08.jpg" alt="" /></a>
							<p align="justify">In the beginning, there was a God who ruled over all creation. The angels, humans, and demons all worshipped this God and obeyed his every command. But one day, the unthinkable happened - the God died.</p>
							<p align="justify">Chaos erupted as the three groups struggled to come to terms with this new reality. The angels were filled with sorrow, as they had always believed that they were the chosen ones of God. The demons saw this as an opportunity to seize power for themselves, while the humans were left feeling lost and alone in a world without a higher power to guide them.</p>
							<p align="justify">But amidst the confusion and despair, the author emerged. He believed that there was a way for the angels, humans, and demons to find meaning and happiness even in the absence of God. That author argued that each group had the power to create their own destiny, and that by working together, they could create a world that was truly worth living in. He argued that the angels had the power to inspire and uplift, the humans had the power to create and innovate, and the demons had the power to challenge and push boundaries.</p>
							<p align="justify">Slowly but surely, the three groups began to understand and appreciate each other in a way that they never had before. The angels began to see that the humans and demons had unique talents and abilities that they had previously overlooked, and the humans and demons began to see the value of the angels' wisdom and compassion. As they worked together to build a new world, the angels, humans, and demons found that they were able to create something truly remarkable. They built great cities, invented new technologies, and explored the furthest reaches of the universe. And through it all, they remained united, their differences no longer a source of conflict but a source of strength.</p>
							<p align="justify">In the end, the author teachings had led the three groups to a new understanding of themselves and each other. They had learned that even in a world without God, they were capable of creating something truly beautiful and meaningful - and they had done it together.</p>

								<h2><strong>Taste of Death</strong></h2>

							<p align="justify">In the depths of a forest, there lived a wise old man who spent his days meditating and contemplating the mysteries of life and death. One day, as he sat in quiet reflection, he suddenly felt a strange sensation in his mouth, as if he had just tasted something bitter and acrid.</p>
							<p align="justify">At first, the old man was puzzled by this taste, but as he continued to meditate, he began to understand its meaning. It was the taste of the seconds of death - the fleeting moments between life and the afterlife, where the soul hovers in a state of limbo before moving on to its final destination.</p>
							<p align="justify">The old man was struck by the profound nature of this experience. For him, it was a reminder that life is fleeting and that we must seize every moment and make the most of our time on this earth. He saw in the taste of the seconds of death a profound truth about the nature of existence - that everything is impermanent, and that we must learn to accept and embrace change in all its forms.</p>
							<p align="justify">The taste of the seconds of death became a symbol for the old man, a constant reminder of the transitory nature of life and the need to seek out truth and meaning in every moment. And as he continued his meditations, he felt a deep sense of peace and contentment, knowing that he had come to understand one of the great mysteries of the universe.</p>

							<p align="justify">Once there was a man, strong and fearless, who believed that he was invincible. He climbed mountains, swam in the deepest oceans, and fought battles with unwavering courage. His body was his temple, and he took great care of it, nourishing it with only the finest foods and pushing it to its limits in his never-ending pursuit of greatness.</p>
							<p align="justify">But one day, he began to feel a strange ache in his bones. At first, he dismissed it as a minor injury, the price of his relentless pursuit of physical perfection. But as the pain grew more intense, he began to fear that something more sinister was at work. He consulted with the finest doctors and healers, but none could find the source of his discomfort. It was only after many long months of agony that he received the devastating diagnosis: bone cancer.</p>
							<p align="justify">The man was shattered. How could this happen to him, the invincible one, the conqueror of mountains and oceans? But as he grappled with his mortality, a strange transformation began to take place within him. He realized that his body was not invincible, that even the strongest of us are vulnerable to the whims of fate. But he also realized that his spirit was unbreakable, that he could face any challenge with courage and resilience.</p>
							<p align="justify">And so, he began a new journey, one of acceptance and enlightenment. He embraced the impermanence of his physical form and focused on cultivating the strength of his inner being. He found peace in the knowledge that he had lived his life to the fullest, that he had conquered every obstacle with courage and determination. As the cancer ravaged his body, he remained resolute, a testament to the indomitable will of the human spirit. And when he finally passed from this world, he left behind a legacy of courage and strength that would inspire generations to come.</p>
							<p align="justify">For in the end, it was not his physical form that defined him, but the depth of his character, the power of his will, and the immensity of his spirit. In the face of death, he proved that true greatness lies not in the conquest of the physical world, but in the conquest of oneself.</p>

It saw the people rushing by, the cars honking, the buildings towering above. It saw the chaos and noise of the city, and it began to reflect on its own existence.</p>
							<p align="justify">"Why am I here?" the poop wondered. "What is my purpose in this world?"</p>
							<p align="justify">It pondered these questions for days and nights, through rain and sun, until it finally came to a realization: it was not just a piece of poop, but a symbol of something greater.</p>
							<p align="justify">"I am the embodiment of waste," the poop thought. "I am the result of excess and consumption. I am a reminder that everything in this world has a consequence."</p>
							<p align="justify">And so the poop began to see itself as wise, a beacon of truth in a world full of falsehoods. It saw itself as a philosopher, a thinker, a master of its own destiny. And although it remained in its place on the street corner, it felt content in its newfound wisdom. For it knew that its mere existence was a reminder of the deeper truths of life, and that was enough.</p>

But one day, this stone began to feel a strange and insatiable hunger, a desire to possess and consume everything it could lay its hands on.</p>
							<p align="justify">At first, the sea stone was content to take only small things - a bit of seaweed here, a shiny shell there. But as its appetite grew, so did its ambition. Soon, it was snatching up entire schools of fish, ripping through seaweed beds with its jagged edges, and even trying to swallow other stones whole.</p>
							<p align="justify">As the sea stone grew more and more consumed by its greed, it became increasingly isolated from the other creatures of the sea. No longer content to simply be a part of the ecosystem, it sought to dominate it, to bend it to its will. It cared not for the delicate balance of nature, only for its own satisfaction.</p>
							<p align="justify">But in the end, the sea stone's greed proved to be its undoing. It became so large and heavy with all the things it had consumed that it could no longer move or even breathe. Trapped at the bottom of the ocean, it realized too late that its insatiable hunger had led it to a fate worse than death - a fate of eternal stagnation and isolation. And so the sea stone lay there, a monument to its own hubris, forever consumed by the very thing it had thought would bring it power and fulfillment. In this tragic tale a cautionary parable about the dangers of allowing our own desires to consume us, and the importance of recognizing the limits of our own power and ambition.</p>
